== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a script? =

On the "Add New" tab, select the location for the script (header or footer) and whether you want it to be global or page-specific. If its global, simply enter a name and the content of the script. If page-specific, select the post type and the post for which to add the script. Then enter a name and the script content.

= How do I delete a script? =

On either the "Global" or "Specific Location" tabs, click the delete (X) button next to the script you would like to delete. Confirm your decision to delete and then click "Update Scripts".

On either the "Global" or "Specific Location" tabs, simply click and drag the script to the new position you would like it to be. Then click "Update Scripts".
